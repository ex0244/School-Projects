## Project Description

This is a little project I had to do for school and was very pleased with. 
It may be a little overwhelming compared to the original exercise but hey 
really liked programming it :D

### The Exercise

The task was to create a duplicate of a game called [Super Six](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Six_(Spiel)), where you get a kind of board with squares that you have to fill in by rolling the dice. All the numbers from 1 to 5 are simply notches and the 6 is a hole. Each player is given the same number of sticks with which they must fill the squares on the board. All players must roll the dice at least once and if the player rolls a 5, for example, he must put one of his sticks in the corresponding square. If he rolls a 6, the stick falls into the hole and is gone for the entire game.  
If a player now rolls a number where the corresponding square is already occupied, he must take the stick, his turn is over and the next player rolls  (In my version the player who failed has to take all the sticks that are currently on the game board).
